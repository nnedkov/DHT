Our Git workflow

Before you start working:
1) make sure you are on your branch
$ git branch (should show)
* Hazboun
  master

if not, type
$git checkout Hazboun (it changes your current working branch to "Hazboun")


When you finish your work:
1) commit the changes you desire
$ git add changed_files_you_want_to_commit
$ git commit

2) switch to the master branch
$ git checkout master

3) pull any new incoming commits from the remote master
$ git pull origin master

4) rebase your working branch on top of the master branch
$ git checkout Hazboun (change currently working branch to "Hazboun")
$ git rebase master

in case there are conflicts (not very likely), contact me

5) go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge with the working branch
$ git checkout master (change currently working branch to "master")
$ git merge Hazboun

6) push the changes of the master branch to the remote repository
(assuming that you are on master branch)
$ git push origin master

7) push the changes of the branch Hazboun to the remote repository
(assuming that you are on master branch)
$ git checkout Hazboun (change currently working branch to "Hazboun")
$ git push -f origin Hazboun (force push changes to "origin/Hazboun")
